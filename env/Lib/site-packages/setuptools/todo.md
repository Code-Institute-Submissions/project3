Fixes:

- [difficult] when you create a new vote on a feature, it should NOT be marked "complete". When you make the payment, paypal should
  "callback" to the app so that we can mark the payment as complete. This prevents users creating a new payment but not actually
   following through with the payment
- [medium] if the above is issue is fixed, then you can also filter out all incomplete payments from the data or listings
